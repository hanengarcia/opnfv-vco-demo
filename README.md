# OPNFV VCO Demo for OPNFV Summit, June 12-15, 2017 in Beijing

Leading up to the OPNFV Summit in Beijing, 25 volunteers from 10 companies in the OPNFV and OpenDaylight communities came together build a functional demo of a Virtual Central Office (VCO). From the time the lab configuration was in place, the team needed just three weeks to build a comprehensive VCO proof of concept demo showing both business and residential services. The demo was unveiled at the Summit — from the keynote stage and in a demo booth — showing the power of open source communities to enable rapid industry collaboration and innovation.
